<h1> Mr Marchant.. this page is dedicated to you. Because I have such a deep regard for you.  </h1>
<h2> In this article.. I will discuss key points in Mr. Marchants life.  </h2>

<h1> Background </h1>
<p> I met Mr Marchant on August 12, at 1:44. It was the second greatest day of my life. Even though it was a few days ago... It feels like it was yestreday. Mr. Marchant is my AP computer science, and this just so happened to be my favorite subject at the time. Let me tell you a little bit about him. Mr. Marchant is a teacher/cross country coach. Mr. Marchant is 5'11 on a good day, and wears these lucious glasses everyday and runs a 2:35 mile. Ridiculous, huh.  </p>
<h1> Beginnings </h1>
<p> Mr Marchant was born on 9/22/92. This would be the best day of my life, even though I wasn't born. His parents name are unknown, and I will hope to find out this infomration later in life. Mr. Marchant was born into a home with 5 brothers, and a mom and a dad. I think. Mr. Marchant was always the first kid in line at the lunch line, and would have all the girls until that unfaithful day. Mr. Marchant would acquire a girlfriend. He would go to homecoming with her three times, even one of these times winning free tickets. Mr. Marchant as soon as he found out they won, he ran to town center and into Walmart, and purchased the most expensive flowers he could afford. This is just one of the many deep stories Mr. Marchant experienced when he was a yougnster. </h1>
<h1> Mr. Marchant hates me? </h1>
<p> This past month me and Mr. Marchant have gotten so close to the point that we are so close. I stole that line from Kamala. haha. One day I was annoying Mr. Marchant so much to the point he started crashing out hard. I mean hard. It got to a point where I jokingly said, "Mr. Marchant wants me to drop this class so badly." Mr. Marchant would then reply with, "You can techinally still drop the class before the end of semester." This implied that Mr. Marchant wanted me to drop the class imemediatley. For the next few days this sent me into a downward sprial and I wanted to commit soduku. Another event that just occured in Mr. Marchants class happened 9/26/24. Mr. Marchant informed us that we would have a lockdown drill. The lockdown drill eventually came and we would all go to the corner. Let me tell you, I just could not keep it all together. I just burst out laughing randomly every 5 seconds. Mr. Marchant would then stare at me with the look of disappointment, and the look of "if this were real, we'd all be dead." This is just one of the many mean/nice things Mr. Marchant has said/done to me. </p>
<h1> The End. </h1>
<p> Mr. Marchant and I have been really tight since that faithful day August 12, 2024. However, this could possibly be the last class I have with Mr. Marchant. Unfortunately for me, and fortunately for Mr. Marchant, he only teaches one period of Physics H. (one period) I do plan on taking this course next year, which techinally means I still have a chance! However the likelyhood of this happening is very small especially since I will most likely take it as a 0 period. However Mr. Marchant, our last class together will be May 29, 2025. This will be a very hard time for the both of us i'm sure.   </p>
